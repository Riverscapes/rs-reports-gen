    <p>The riverscapes stream names report is intended to provide an accessible introduction to the the named streams
      within a specific area of interest. It pulls together data from a variety of public sources and combines them with
      the results from several models. The goal is to encourage exploration of the riverscape and the landscape context
      in which it resides.</p>

  <h2>Stream Names</h2>
  <div class="section-context">
    <p>The stream names come from NHD data aggregated as part of the Riverscapes Context project. The size of the name
      is proportional to Riverscape length and the colour represents the maximum stream order for this stream within the
      area of interest (darker colour = larger stream order). Only top 200 named streams (by Riverscape length) are
      shown; the full list can be found in the report data folder.</p>
