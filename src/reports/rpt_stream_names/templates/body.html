    <p>The riverscapes stream names report is intended to provide an accessible introduction to the the named streams
      within a specific area of interest. It pulls together data from a variety of public sources and combines them with
      the results from several models. The goal is to encourage exploration of the riverscape and the landscape context
      in which it resides.</p>

  <h2>Stream Names</h2>
  <h3>Name diversity</h3>
  <div class="section-context">
    <p>When setlers were naming streams, lives were much more local than they are today. There was no national registry
      like the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic Names
        Information System</a>. As a result, many different stream share names. This word cloud illustrates this by
      making the size of the name proportional to the number of individual <b>level paths</b> that use that name within
      the area of interest. Only the 200 named streams (by distinct level paths) are shown; the full list can be found
      in the report data folder. Note - the word cloud algorithm adjusts word sizes to fit the shape and this effect is
      more pronounced for small areas with just a few stream names. Consult the included data files for accurate values.

  <h3>Riverscape Length</h3>
  <div class="section-context">
    <p>The stream names come from NHD data aggregated as part of the Riverscapes Context project. In this word cloud,
      the size of the name
      is proportional to Riverscape length and the colour represents the maximum stream order for this stream within the
      area of interest (darker colour = larger stream order). Only top 200 named streams (by Riverscape length) are
      shown; the full list can be found in the report data folder.</p>

  <h3>Riverscape Area per length</h3>
  <div class="section-context">
    <p>The stream names come from NHD data aggregated as part of the Riverscapes Context project. In this word cloud,
      the size of the name
      is proportional to Riverscape area divided by riverscape length and the colour represents the maximum stream order
      for this stream within the
      area of interest (darker colour = larger stream order). Only top 200 named streams (by this metric) are
      shown; the full list can be found in the report data folder.</p>
