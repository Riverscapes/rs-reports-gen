    <p>The riverscapes inventory report provides insight into the current state and health of riverine ecosystems. It
      pulls together data from a variety of public sources and combines them with the results from several models
      covering a range of topics from valley bottom identification, beaver restoration and riparian condition. The goal
      is to provide a broad overvew of the riverscape and the landscape context in which it resides.</p>

  <h2>Appendix 2 - Source Data</h2>
  <div class="section-context">
    <p>This report was generated using data from the <a href="https://data.riverscapes.net">Riverscapes Data
        Exchange</a>. Free, pubicly accessibable data were processed through a series of models by the Riverscapes
      Consortium, culminating with the Riverscapes Metric Engine (RME) that synthesizes metrics together for all the
      preceeding models. These RME data are based on polygons that span the valley bottom and are segmented at a
      distance that varies with drainage area. These polygons, or discreet geographic objects (DGOs) possess over 100
      metrics spanning a variety of topics pertaining to riverscape health.</p>
    <p>The model runs in question were all part of an initiative to produce a continuous riverscapes dataset for the <a
        href="https://docs.riverscapes.net/initiatives/CONUS-runs">Conterminous United States in 2025</a>.</p>
