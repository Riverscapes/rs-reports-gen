# IGOs Project

The contents of this folder were generated programatically using the [Riverscapes reporting system](https://reports.riverscapes.net) IGO Report version {{report_version}}.

The data come from a 'scrape' of all the [Riverscapes Metric Engine (RME)](https://tools.riverscapes.net/rme/) projects in the [Riverscape Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/) created as part of the [2025 CONUS Run](https://docs.riverscapes.net/initiatives/CONUS-runs/). This scrape represents a snapshot in time that precedes the report run date. Data may be incomplete and have not been thoroughly quality controlled. No fitness for use is warranted or implied.

An IGO is an Integrated Geographic Object. It represents a point in the middle of a Discrete Geographic Object (DGO) on the valley centerline. The points in this project are not the IGO points; they are a centroid of the DGO polygon that may not be on the valley centerline.

It is structured as a [Riverscapes Project](https://docs.riverscapes.net/products/data-exchange/advanced/data-exchange-api#projects) of type `IGOs`.

This means that you can use any Riverscapes Viewer (for QGIS or ArcGIS) to explore the contents with pre-defined views and symbology. However the data formats are all open and you can use your favourite tools to work with any of these files.

## Details of Folder Contents

* `project.rs.xml` this defines the contents in the format used by Riverscapes viewers
* `project_bounds.geojson` a (potentially simplified) representation of the area that was queried
* `report.log` is a logfile generated by the python script - contains basic information such as the time of the run, any warnings or errors, and debug information.

### Riverscapes-metrics GeoPackage

* `outputs\riverscapes-metrics.gkpg` is a [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/), an SQLite database with additional capabilities for handling geospatial information. This contains all the data for the project and as described further below.

#### Tables

All tables can be joined using the field `dgoid` -- which is exactly what we did with the views (see below).

* dgos - contains the point geometry of the IGO
* dgo_beaver
* dgo_desc descriptive
* dgo_geomorph
* dgo_hydro
* dgo_impacts
* dgo_veg

#### Views

These are spatial views that join the dgo geometry with the attributes tables, so they can be added as individual layers in QGis.

* vw_dgo_beaver_metrics
* vw_dgo_desc_metrics
* vw_dgo_geomorph_metrics
* vw_dgo_hydro_metrics
* vw_dgo_impacts_metrics
* vw_dgo_metrics
* vw_dgo_veg_metrics

#### Columns

See the full list of columns and their metadata in [column_metadata.csv](column_metadata.csv).

* `column_metadata.csv` includes the names, descriptions and units of measure for all the columns. Metadata are also provided in the GeoPackage.

## Source Projects

* `source_projects.csv` lists all the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) projects, along with links to them, that were used as source material ("scraped") to generate this extract
