    <p>This Rivers Need Space Report describe the current riverscape and the space that it occupies. It provides
      insights into the character of the riverscape for the entire floodplain in which the current river resides.</p>
    <p>Use this report to understand the current condition of the riverscape, identify areas where the river has been
      constrained, and prioritize areas for restoration or conservation efforts. The report includes maps, charts, and
      tables that illustrate key aspects of the riverscape, such as land use, vegetation cover, and floodplain
      connectivity.</p>

  <h2>Appendix 2 - Source Data</h2>
  <div class="section-context">
    <p>This report was generated using data from the <a href="https://data.riverscapes.net">Riverscapes Data
        Exchange</a>. Free, pubicly accessibable data were processed through a series of models by the Riverscapes
      Consortium, culminating with the Riverscapes Metric Engine (RME) that synthesizes metrics together for all the
      preceeding models. These RME data are based on polygons that span the valley bottom and are segmented at a
      distance that varies with drainage area. These polygons, or discreet geographic objects (DGOs) possess over 100
      metrics spanning a variety of topics pertaining to riverscape health.</p>
    <p>The model runs in question were all part of an initiative to produce a continuous riverscapes dataset for the <a
        href="https://docs.riverscapes.net/initiatives/CONUS-runs">Conterminous United States in 2025</a>.</p>
