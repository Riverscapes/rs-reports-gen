## Demo HTML

The purpose of the demo HTML is to create patterns that will then be used in the `template.html` file to create the final report.

The demo HTML is not intended to be a final report, but rather a way to visualize and test the patterns that will be used in the final report.

It has a number of dummy placeholder elements that are not used in the final report, but are useful for testing and visualizing the patterns.
