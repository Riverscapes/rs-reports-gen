"""
Extract raw_rme data from athena for an area of interest (shape)
Because athena doesn't have spatial indexes we do a pre-selection on bounding box

Lorin Gaertner 
August 2025

1. get bounding box of aoi
2. buffer it 
3. sql prequery on lat lon within buffered bounding box
4. get the shape in queryable format
    option 1 (chosen) - produce and use wkt or wkb string for query
    option 2 - upload the shape to s3/create athena table
5. query the dgos for the actual aoi
    option 1 (chosen) - (most accurate way) query st_intersects aoi and dgo geometry 
    option 2 - (faster way) query dgo point within aoi 

Output can then be further processed with athena_to_rme.py

Assumption: 
* provided a geojson in epsg 4326

Future enhancements: 
* attach attributes from aoi to result - especially useful for multi-polygon aoi 
* provide ability to simplify the shape if it is not simple enough to handle in query 
* check for gaps in raw_rme coverage (query huc10_geom and vw_projects)
